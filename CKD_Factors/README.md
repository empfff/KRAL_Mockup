# CKD Factors
This repo contains code to answer the following kidney research question.
>What factors, including environmental risk factors; social determinants of health; and clinical factors such as AKI, biomarkers, comorbidities, and health care utilization patterns, are the best predictors of the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)? Do the factors differ in the context of a specific subset of CKD, such as glomerular disease? Can subphenotypes of CKD be ascertained from patterns of exacerbating factors?
